HTML to PNG Server

by Adam Hooper <adam@adamhooper.com>

PURPOSE

This program accepts HTML and outputs PNG representations of it.

FEATURES

- Runs as an HTTP server on port 20558
- Renders with multiple strategies:
  - Internet Explorer on Windows
  - Firefox 3 on Ubuntu Linux
- Can crop images from different rendering strategies so their outputs
  correspond, ideally pixel-for-pixel.

REQUIREMENTS

You must have a Java 6.0 runtime available. Individual rengering strategies
have thier own requirements. (Peruse their source code for details.)

USAGE

This server is intended for a distributed environment (or, at least, an
environment which you foresee to be distributed in the future.) The server
should be run on each "renderer" node--that is, the computer which will
perform the actual rendering, as opposed to the client which will manipulate
those results.

To start the server: java -jar /path/to/html_to_png_server.jar

A client may request a PNG from the server by sending a utf-8 POST request to
"http://node.domain.or.ip.address:20558/STRATEGY", where "STRATEGY" is one of
"ff3-linux", "ie", or anything else registered in HtmlToPngHttpServer.java. The
POST request should consist exclusively of utf8-encoded HTML; the server will
respond with PNG data.

CLIENTS

Known clients include:

- html_render, by Adam Hooper
  http://github.com/adamh/html_render/tree/master
    A Ruby library which provides an API to html_to_png_server (including
    multi-threaded, distributed rendering) with special classes for integrating
    with unit testing libraries.

DEVELOPMENT

The code is fairly (though by no means expertly) organized. Open this folder in
Eclipse and enjoy yourself.

Feel free to send me any patches, generated through "git format-patch" or,
slightly less helpfully, "diff -u". I will concern myself with regenerating
"ie-thumbnail-generator.exe" and "html_to_png_server.jar".

As far as I can see, the client/server API will not change. As for this
server's internals: no APIs should be considered stable.

sensible. I declare myself absolved of my copyright on this code.
