Internet Explorer Thumbnail Generator

by Adam Hooper <adam@adamhooper.com>

PURPOSE

Renders the given URL in Internet Explorer and outputs the result as a PNG
(which, incidentally, may be taller than the 1024x768 at which the page is
rendered).

USAGE

thumbnail-generator.exe [URL] [PNG output filename]

BUILDING

1. Download and install the (free) Microsoft .NET 2.0 SDK.
2. Open the SDK command-line and "cd" to this directory.
3. Run "nmake".

The output file, "thumbnail-generator.exe", will be generated.

LIMITATIONS

- The program must be run within a user's session.
- All screenshots are 1024 pixels wide.
- During execution, a large, visible window will be opened. (This is not a
  serious problem in testing environments in which users do not need
  mouse/keyboard interaction with the computer.)
- The render only happens after the page is loaded--that is, all images have
  been downloaded. This makes the process rather slow if CSS or image files
  are linked into the page.
- You can only render a single file in each execution (meaning the startup and
  shutdown overhead must be incurred for every render).

LICENSE

This program is the fruit of a long, twisted path of Google searches and
doggedness. I copy/pasted ruthlessly from public forums. I like to think that
the resulting source code is public-domain or at least open-source in some
general sense. If I am wrong, please contact me at adam@adamhooper.com and I
will quickly do all I can to ensure an equivalent program exists in the
public domain.

(This should help to explain why this source code is so darned ugly, too.)

BUGS/SUGGESTIONS

Contact me at adam@adamhooper.com. I promise I'll at least try to respond.
(I do not, however, promise to go out of my way to solve your problems.)
